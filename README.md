# Standardised Variant Definitions

This is a repository containing the up-to-date lineage definitions for variants of concern (VOC) and other variants (V) as curated by UK Health Security Agency. They are provided in order to facilitate standardised VOC and V calling across sequencing sites and bioinformatics pipelines and are the same definitions used internally at Public Health England. The mutations have been chosen to aid rapid and sensitive identification from sequence data: these are typically only a subset of the total set of mutations found in a variant. 

Variant definitions are subject to change at any time. The latest release can be downloaded under the releases tab. A <a href="CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG</a> is available. For email notifications when this repository is updated, please use the GitHub "Watch" functionality at the top right of this page.

## File format definition

Each variant is stored one-per-file in the `variant_yaml` directory. Each file should be syntactically correct YAML. The file should be named according to its `unique-id` (unique identifer) with the suffix `.yml`.

You can check that files are correct using the `yaml-validator.py` script.
